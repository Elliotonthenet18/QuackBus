## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Create directory and download:**
```bash
mkdir quackbus && cd quackbus
```

2. **Create docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
services:
  quackbus:
    image: elliotonthenet18/quackbus:latest
    container_name: quackbus
    ports:
      - "7277:7277"
    volumes:
      - ./downloads:/app/downloads
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./logs:/app/logs  # Add logs volume
      - ./temp:/app/temp  
      - /path/to/your/music/folder:/app/music  # Change this to your actual music directory
    environment:
      # Download Configuration
      - DEFAULT_QUALITY=7  # 7=Hi-Res, 6=CD Quality, 5=MP3 320k
      - DOWNLOAD_PATH=/app/music
      - TEMP_PATH=/app/temp
      
      # Metadata Configuration
      - EMBED_ARTWORK=true
      - ORGANIZE_BY_ARTIST=true
      - CREATE_ALBUM_FOLDERS=true
      
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

3. **Edit the music folder path:**
```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
# Change this line:
# - /path/to/your/music/folder:/app/music
# To your actual music folder, for example:
# - /home/username/Music:/app/music
```

4. **Start QuackBus:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. **Access the interface:**
```
http://localhost:7277
```

### After running, you'll have:
```
quackbus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ downloads/           # Temporary download staging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/               # Application data and download history
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/               # Application logs (if mapped)
```

Plus your music will be organized in your specified music folder!

## üìÅ File Organization

Downloads are automatically organized as:
```
music/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artist Name - Album Name (Year)/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01 - Track Name.flac
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02 - Track Name.flac
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cover.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Port 7277 already in use:
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :7277
# Stop the application and restart
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

### Container won't start:
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs quackbus
# Check container status
docker-compose ps
```

### View application logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f quackbus
```

### Restart the application:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Download history not persisting:
Make sure the `./data` volume is properly mapped in your docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data  # This persists download history
```
